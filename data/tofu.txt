Why do white people treat tofu like a meat substitute?
The hell do you mean buttermilk fried tofu chicken? This is why people hate white vegans bro, did you just try to hand me a bowl of tofu chili? I’m going to perform a citizens arrest and extradite you to China. Tofu is its own thing, an ingredient with its own identity which should be treated as such. As a cook, very few things piss me off more than westerners trying to make tofu something it’s not when you can just play to tofu’s inherent strengths when building a dish instead of haphazardly making trendy vegan bullshit versions of meat-based dishes. Dishonorable mention goes to meatless mapo tofu that white people make sometimes, that shit sucks.
