Title: Moving from Canada to Europe as an Asian Male: What Should I Expect?
Body:
Hey everyone,
I’m an Asian male (30) who’s about to move from Canada to France (not Paris), and I’m feeling a bit uncertain about what to expect. I’ve spent the last 7 years in Canada, where I found it challenging to make deep, meaningful friendships. While I didn’t face any overt racism, I often felt that the connections I made were somewhat surface-level.
Now, as I prepare to move to a smaller community in France, I’m concerned about how I’ll be perceived as a non-white person. Will it be even harder to connect with people? Should I be worried about experiencing racism or being excluded?
For those of you who have lived in both Canada and Europe as an Asian male, what were your experiences like? Did you find it easier or harder to build relationships? Were people more or less welcoming? I’m particularly interested in hearing about life outside of major cities.
I’d appreciate any advice or insights you might have!
Thanks!

Title: Why do white people treat tofu like a meat substitute?
Body:
The hell do you mean buttermilk fried tofu chicken? This is why people hate white vegans bro, did you just try to hand me a bowl of tofu chili? I’m going to perform a citizens arrest and extradite you to China. Tofu is its own thing, an ingredient with its own identity which should be treated as such. As a cook, very few things piss me off more than westerners trying to make tofu something it’s not when you can just play to tofu’s inherent strengths when building a dish instead of haphazardly making trendy vegan bullshit versions of meat-based dishes. Dishonorable mention goes to meatless mapo tofu that white people make sometimes, that shit sucks.

Title: An update on the cultural appropriation question
Body:
It turns out Megan isn't as much of an ally as we thought. In her song “no heart”. She says “Eyes so low like I'm Sue Call me ching chong” I hate to say "I told you so," but I had a feeling this would happen. The video she made didn't come across as genuinely interested or respectful. It felt more opportunistic and exploitive. I love anime and am mixed Asian myself, but I would never exploit Japanese culture just because I enjoy anime.
It's like saying, "I liked Rush Hour, so I'm going to wear qipaos for the rest of my life and profit off exploiting Chinese culture." This defense misses the point and shows a lack of genuine respect for the culture. I’m wondering if she will release a statement apologising for her past lyrics or just sweep it under the rug. Before this fiasco, I’ve seen a lot of netizens on xiaohongshu hated the MV, despite a lot of AA(Asian Americans) loving it.

(Sorry if this post isn’t welcome here, I unfortunately cannot resist to scratch the itch that is “I told you so”😂😣)
