How they don't report crime, they are quiet, submissive, don't fight back, Asian women will blame themselves and their societies will victim blame them etc and the disgraceful rise of \"passportbros\"?\nAndrew Schultz went on the Joe Rogan podcast talking about how Asian women having tighter pussies \"for some reason\" *wink* *wink* implying because Asian men are smaller.\nRampage Jackson also went on the Joe Rogan podcast talking about Japan and how they are all sexless there etc and he women there will treat you well and love foreign men etc\nThere was also this clip that went viral of Jiaoying Summers, an Asian female comedian talking about how the best Asian woman to get overseas is from the countryside. Because she will not be polluted by capitalism, will be submissive to you, listen to you, and is more pure and innocent.\nIt's disgusting"

But towards the middle I noticed something was wrong. They changed the main characters' personality completely and made his some kind of bitter incel. He was super rude to his parents that even his white 'friends' had to call him out on it and they even depicted the father as being absent.\nAfter reading through this sub, I have become painfully aware of how Asian American men are treated and the trailer makes you think its going to be a fun movie but then it ends up being one of the most depressing things you've ever seen.\nI don't like how hollywood will only depict asian men in these weird ways even in movies dedicated for asians.\nDoes anyone know, is it a boba liberal production? From what I can see the director is an asian men so I don't know why he decided to have such a negative portrayal of asians. Even towards the end my boyfriend pointed out that the only person didi committed violence to was the Korean kid which I also thought was a weird choice.\nEDIT: But I just found it weird how it singled out east asian men as being weird loners with no friends, no social skills and are absent from life. There's too much of that in the media already but I found it worse than even the awkward tween stuff. The beginning was awkward angsty tween stuff, what it morphed into was something weirder entirely.\nJust found out the producers were white males which explains alot. Please don't watch the movie, it promotes a certain image of asian men\nEDIT2: After thinking about it, I realized that the whole point of the movie is to single out the Asian character as someone who had something intesely, deeply wrong with HIM. It's not his tween angst because the beginning is about that. Nobody showed him racism (except for a small incident with that girl) and even then his response was to self isolate.\nIt was weird and gave me big incel vibes."

Asian hatred was on a whole other level back then, people one time spat on me out of nowhere or punched me in my face.\nI had one loyal customer who was initially hostile to me, but after several years he apologized to me for being rude. He said that thanks to us, he was able to afford things he otherwise couldn't have bought, and it helped him get through hard times. (he passed away unfortunately, rip and thank you)\nAs of now, Chinese companies like Xiaomi and Byd received backlash from several european manufacturers saying that they are killing companies there. It might sound harsh from my side, but when 70% of the population just makes ends meet, especially in poorer countries, what does advancements in technology matter when it's inaccessible to the public? Who cares about the next Nasa mission on Mars when people can't afford basic food and rent every month? Since asian companies went to Europe, for example in my country, tesla car prices went down 20%, and there is no way they wanted to do that. They did because we forced them to. People are now using Samsung and Xiaomi phones, because people gradually realize that Iphones are way too overpriced. People don't realize that almost every basic neccesity that they take for granted today is cheap mainly because of the pressure from asian companies to push prices down. The western world is way too spoiled. (Volkswagen car in China is 18k, in Europe 40k, like what the actual fuck)\nI'm not saying that all white people are bad, I have just as many white friends who are kind and friendly, but the system embedded natural racism so much in Europe, due to colonial history, that the society doesn't even recognize that racism is a problem. While the compliments by the minority were rare, this was the reason why I didn't break down emotionally and kept going on. I still have faith that proper education can vastly improve on the situation.\nTo the fellow asians, who experienced the same thing, while racism back then also hurted me deep to my core, it humbled me, and made me grateful for what I am, and truly made me understand that good things can't be truly enjoyed without experiencing the opposite. I hope that in the future, asians will get recognition what we've done to the world, and not view it negatively.\nIf you've read this far, thank you very much for your time to read it, and wish you a very nice day!"

Furthermore, in a video they created nine years ago, they made fun of their height compared to white males and suggested that white males have a preference for Asian women.\nIn contrast, I find Hanswhy's channel to be both informative and inspiring, especially when it comes to Asian stories. While some may find his accent to be a deterrent, I personally find it to be distinctive and genuine. He shares his personal experiences from his youth and encourages others to stand up for themselves, even when our parents advise us to avoid trouble and stay out of situations where non-Asians initiate conflict."

Below is an explanation of each concept, and the outcome of each tactic.\nAssimilation is the eradication of one's culture. To be replaced, often times, with the majority's culture, that, is on average, less productive, and maligned with the interest of the sub-group.  It might be the right culture for the majority culture, who knows, but, it was emergently developed, specifically, for the majority culture. It's equivalent to wearing someone else's bespoke fit jacket, instead, of making your own bespoke jacket. It's a maladapted culture for the Asian-American community's circumstance.\nIntegration, on the other hand, is to have a distinctive culture, that is adapted to the local circumstance. So to be compatible with the majority culture, while also serving the interest of sustaining and furthering the sub-group, and also others(by virtue of superior value creation than the majority in a few particular aspects) that are outside of the sub-group(as means for fair play).\nIf you have been paying attention. Assimilation, is a scheme, foisted by the majority group(and perpetrated by  non-discerning Asian Americans), to groom the Asian American sub-group for exploitation.  Why the majority behaves like that, rather than create immense value, and facilitate fair play, who knows? Integration is to take control of one's ownership of their own minority community, and sustain and adapt. So to create immense value(and benefit from that value), and safety.\nRecap.\nChoose integration of a distinct sub-culture(into the local and national environment) that has distinctive specialized competencies not readily found in the majority community. So to be an 'indispensable pivotal community'.\nDo not assimilation to the majority culture, and utilize a generic strategy that is only suited to the majority group.\nTwo seemingly similar concept. Two diametrically opposed outcomes."
