We both saw the trailer and thought it would be your typical slice of life but with Asians as the protagonists. But towards the middle I noticed something was wrong. They changed the main characters' personality completely and made his some kind of bitter incel. He was super rude to his parents that even his white 'friends' had to call him out on it and they even depicted the father as being absent.\n\nAfter reading through this sub, I have become painfully aware of how Asian American men are treated and the trailer makes you think its going to be a fun movie but then it ends up being one of the most depressing things you've ever seen.\n\nI don't like how hollywood will only depict asian men in these weird ways even in movies dedicated for asians.\n\nDoes anyone know, is it a boba liberal production? From what I can see the director is an asian men so I don't know why he decided to have such a negative portrayal of asians. Even towards the end my boyfriend pointed out that the only person didi committed violence to was the Korean kid which I also thought was a weird choice.\n\nEDIT: But I just found it weird how it singled out east asian men as being weird loners with no friends, no social skills and are absent from life. There's too much of that in the media already but I found it worse than even the awkward tween stuff. The beginning was awkward angsty tween stuff, what it morphed into was something weirder entirely.\n\nJust found out the producers were white males which explains alot. Please don't watch the movie, it promotes a certain image of asian men\n\nEDIT2: After thinking about it, I realized that the whole point of the movie is to single out the Asian character as someone who had something intesely, deeply wrong with HIM. It's not his tween angst because the beginning is about that. Nobody showed him racism (except for a small incident with that girl) and even then his response was to self isolate.\n\nIt was weird and gave me big incel vibes.\n\n\nExample response:\nMovie perpetuates negative Asian male stereotypes üò°",

I was a pedestrian just walking down the sidewalk. This was downtown Seattle, not very busy street due to our statewide stay at home orders. I‚Äôm 45, half Korean/Vietnamese. 1st Gen, been here since 7yrs old.\n\nThis 20‚Äôs white girl was pulling out of street parking and basically crashed into a car that was just driving by. She got out and was all upset saying,‚Äùyou saw my blinker, why didn‚Äôt you move out of the way‚Äù? I laughed to myself when I heard this. The people in the car that was hit, began to get out. They were an older Korean couple that could speak only a little English. I think normally, I would have kept walking to stay out of it but I felt compelled to get involved because of her demeanor. I only speak a little bit of Korean, but enough to communicate with the couple. I felt like I had to help stand up for the Korean couple because the girl that came out into the street, was really acting like she did nothing wrong, and was being loud about it. The Korean couple was struggling to understand what she was even saying, and was just pointing to the giant scrape along their car from the front to back of the whole passenger side of their car. I realized that the girl clearly was under her normal ‚Äúattractive white girl privilege‚Äù, and just assumed that she was going to come out of this situation as if she was in the right. I could not let this older Korean couple get steamrolled by this person. So, I got involved, directed some traffic and then instructed all parties to just exchange drivers license & insurance info. We called the police, but due to Coronavirus, they were only responding to emergencies. I gave both parties my name and number, and since then, I‚Äôve spoken with the girl‚Äôs insurance and am on record as saying, ‚Äúanytime a driver is leaving a parking space, it is their responsibility to ensure it is safe to do so. It was her fault for crashing into the car that had the right of way.‚Äù I know this story is not necessarily an example of overt racism, but the undertones were there, and I actually saw the girls demeanor change a little bit, when I started talking and she realized that I could speak English more eloquently than she could. I just could not let her get away with her wrongdoing by taking advantage of the Korean couple‚Äôs lack of English skills.\n\nUPDATE: Heard from Mr. & Mrs. Kim and am told that the Insurance companies have concluded 100% fault of the girl. Feels like a bit of justice. I‚Äôm glad that I chose to get involved."
